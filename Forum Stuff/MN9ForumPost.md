Introduction:
=============

I have made a set of minimalist icons for Windows and Mac. 
The icons are based on the headphone-like protrusions that are on each of the Mighty Number robots (and Call). 
If anybody knows what the "Earpods" are officially called I'd love to know that!

Enough exposition, lets get to the icons!
